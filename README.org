* About
This is my collection of solutions for [[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] challenges. Most
of these will be done in Common Lisp. I may go back and do some of
them in other languages, too.
* Organization
Each year has its own org file (linked below). From there you can get
to my code and write up for each of the problems I've solved for that
year.
