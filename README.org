* About
This is my collection of solutions for [[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] challenges. Most
of these will be done in Common Lisp.
* Organization
Each year has its own org file (linked below). From there you can get
to my code and write up for each of the problems I've solved for that
year.

2018 is my first year doing this live. As I have time I'm going back
to prior years to practice solving the problems and refine my org-file
template and method of presentation.
* Events
My first year participating is 2018. But I've started going back to
previous years to work through those problems.
