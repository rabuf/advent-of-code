* About
This is my collection of solutions for
[[http://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] challenges. Most of these
will be done in Common Lisp.
* Organization
How I organize and present this is constantly changing. Initially I
wanted one org file per year, but the namespace for code blocks was
getting crowded. My current method is one org file per day. The links
below will take you to the primary org file for each year, and from
there you can get to the org file for a specific challenge.

NB: Not all challenges have been broken out into their own files yet.
* Events
My first year participating is 2018. But I've started going back to
previous years to work through those problems.
