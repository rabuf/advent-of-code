** Executing this code
If you have a lisp installation, emacs, org-mode, and org-babel
support for lisp installed you can run this by:
1. Starting slime (=M-x slime=)
2. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[initialize][initialize]].
3. In the repl type =(in-package :aoc-2015-10)=
4. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[answers][answers]]

** Part 1
The task is to implement the look-and-say sequence. Given a number,
count how many of them there are, say the count and then the number.

First let's implement a single round of the game.
#+NAME: look-and-say
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results none
  (defun look-and-say (s)
    (let ((numbers (mapcar #'parse-integer (ppcre:split "" s)))
          (result nil))
      (iter (for n in numbers)
            (with current = (first numbers))
            (with count = 0)
            (cond ((= current n) (incf count))
                  (t (push (list count current) result)
                     (setf current n)
                     (setf count 1)))
            (finally (push (list count current) result)))
      (format nil "狺" (reverse result))))
#+END_SRC
#+NAME: problem-a
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :noweb yes :results silent
  (defun solve-a (string times)
    (iter (repeat times)
          (setf string (look-and-say string))
          (finally (return (length string)))))
  (defun problem-a () (format t "Problem 10 A: a%" (solve-a *input* 40)))
#+END_SRC
** Part 2
#+NAME: problem-b
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :noweb yes :results silent
  (defun solve-b (string times)
    (iter (repeat times)
          (setf string (look-and-say string))
          (finally (return (length string)))))
  (defun problem-b () (format t "Problem 10 B: a%" (solve-b *input* 50)))

** Tests
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For example:
- 1 becomes 11 (1 copy of digit 1).
- 11 becomes 21 (2 copies of digit 1).
- 21 becomes 1211 (one 2 followed by one 1).
- 1211 becomes 111221 (one 1, one 2, and two 1s).
- 111221 becomes 312211 (three 1s, two 2s, and one 1).
