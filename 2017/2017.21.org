** Executing this code
If you have a lisp installation, emacs, org-mode, and org-babel
support for lisp installed you can run this by:
1. Starting slime (=M-x slime=)
2. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[initialize][initialize]].
3. In the repl type =(in-package :aoc-2017-21)=
4. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[answers][answers]]

Find a matching rule (may have to rotate or flip the image) and
replace with the new value. I'm going to represent the current state
with a pair of hash table (complex -> boolean) and width/height (which
will be the same, it's square).

** Part 2
Very slow approach, it takes about 9.5 seconds on my laptop to run
this one. There is a lot of consing involved. There is certainly a
pattern which can be exploited, but this works well enough.
