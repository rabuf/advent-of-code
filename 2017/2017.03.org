This is an interesting problem. So the memory grows in a spiral. I
have to determine the Cartesian coordinates for the memory cell
identified by the input number, and then calculate it's distance to 1
(the origin).
#+NAME: manhattan-distance
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun manhattan-distance (p1 p2)
    (destructuring-bind ((x1 y1) (x2 y2)) (list p1 p2)
      (+ (abs (- x1 x2)) (abs (- y1 y2)))))

Now we have to convert the input into a position. It's helpful to note
that all *odd* perfect squares occur on a diagonal moving
down-and-right from 1. All *even* perfect squares occur on a diagonal
moving up-and-left from 4. If we know which two perfect squares are
nearest the input then we can identify it's precise location by moving
along the path from (lower square) to (upper square).

Doing this one manually right now, we have:
- lower :: 346921
- upper :: 348100

When examining the squares, the square for the nth odd number
(starting at 1) is located at (n-1,-(n-1)). So 1 is at (0,0). 9 is the
square of 3 (the 2nd odd number) is located at (1,-1), etc.

A similar pattern exists for the squares of even numbers: (-n+1,n).

So we need to determine the locations of *lower* and *upper*.

*lower* is the square of the 294th odd number, and *upper* is the
square of the 295th even number. So that puts our solution along the
path from (294,-294) to (-294,295).

Alright, so I can now convert *squares* to positions. And I can
determine the distance between them. We also know how far from each
our input is. In this case, we're only 109 from *upper*. That's over
half the total distance between *upper* and *lower*, so we can find
our position by moving horizontally right from *upper*.

(-185,295)

The manhattan distance is 480.
