** Executing this code
If you have a lisp installation, emacs, org-mode, and org-babel
support for lisp installed you can run this by:
1. Starting slime (=M-x slime=)
2. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[initialize][initialize]].
3. In the repl type =(in-package :aoc-2016-14)=
4. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[answers][answers]]

** Part 1
This one will be a bit tedious. Taking the input, append a number
starting at 0, and calculate the checksum.

If it contains a digit repeated 3 times in a row, look to the next
1000 checksums and see if that same digit is repeated *5* times in a
row. If it is, we have a key. If not, we don't. Find the index of the
64th key.

I'm trying to think of a good way to do this without doing a ton of
repeat work. I'll search through looking for triples and
quintuples. All triples will be marked as potentials. When a quintuple
is found within the right time (1000 indexes) then the potential will
be moved to a list of keys. Once there are 64 of them, we're done.

** Part 2
This part uses key stretching (repeated md5sums). I'm sure I could
make this faster somehow, but I'm not going to. I'm just happy to be
done with it.

I had an issue in part 1 where I got lucky with the answer. The item
at index (in the array) 64 was the correct answer because I had an
extra item earlier. I should have been retrieving the value from
index 63. The extra item was there because I missed a line in the
spec: only the first triple in a possible key should be used for
verifying it, not any triple in the key. Removing that one and fixing
the indexing means my solution is now actually correct, though very
slow for part 2 because of the repeated hashing.
