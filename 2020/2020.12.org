** Executing this code
If you have a lisp installation, emacs, org-mode, and org-babel
support for lisp installed you can run this by:
1. Starting slime (=M-x slime=)
2. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[initialize][initialize]].
3. In the repl type =(in-package :aoc-2020-12)=
4. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[answers][answers]]

** Part 2
Slightly more complicated for this part. The N/S/E/W/L/R all move the
waypoint. F now moves the ship *to* the waypoint a number of
times. The waypoint itself is always kept a constant position away
from the ship.

I'm going to continue using complex numbers because this makes it
easy. Fundamentally, N/S/E/W don't change except that instead of
changing pos, the waypoint is altered.

L and R, however, are different. It's now rotating *around* the
ship. Which is not too bad. Instead of adjusting a degrees we subtract
ship from waypoint, to place it at the origin, multiply like before,
then add the ship position back to restore it.

A thought, the waypoint can be maintained as simply a vector from the
origin. It's *always* relative to the ship, so we can simplify
rotation and skipping having to adjust it after moving the ship.
