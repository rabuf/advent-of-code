** Executing this code
If you have a lisp installation, emacs, org-mode, and org-babel
support for lisp installed you can run this by:
1. Starting slime (=M-x slime=)
2. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[initialize][initialize]].
3. In the repl type =(in-package :aoc-2020-13)=
4. Typing =C-c C-c= in the block [[answers][answers]]

** Part 2
Ok, I was right not to move the parsing to the top. In this part, line
one doesn't matter. What matters is the second line. Given an input
like =n,m= we want to find the time, =t=, at which =n= would leave and
where =m= leaves at =t+1=. An =x= in the input means we don't care
about that slot, but the index in the input does matter for other
numbers. So =n,x,m= means =n= leaves at =t= and =m= at =t+2=.

For two numbers this isn't too bad to solve. But the search space on
many numbers is very large. I'll make a naive, brute-force version first just to
make sure I understand the logic correctly.
#+NAME: parse-b
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results silent
  (defun parse-b (line)
  "PARSE-B takes a comma separated string, LINE, of numbers and
  `x`s. The return value is a list of (INDEX NUMBER) pairs"
    (loop for i from 0
       for x in (cl-ppcre:split "," line)
       for n = (parse-integer x :junk-allowed t)
       if n
       collect (list i n)))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results silent
  (defun solve-b (numbers)
    (loop for time from 0 by (second (first numbers))
       if (every (lambda (pair)
                   (destructuring-bind (index n) pair
                     (zerop (mod (+ index time) n))))
                 (cdr numbers))
       do (return time)))
#+END_SRC

As it happens that works pretty well, though I imagine it won't be
quick on the real input. However, I don't feel like thinking anymore
so let's run it!

Thoughts: I only optimize by the first parameter. I can do better than
that. Starting with time 1 and n_0 of 1 (this permits the list to
start with a non-zero index more easily) loop over each pair. For each
pair, increment time by n_0 until a valid value is found. Then update
n_0 with $n_0 := n_0 * n$. Repeat until all pairs are evaluated.

               until (zerop (mod (+ a time) n))
